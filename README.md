# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I am a Software Engineer who thrives on collaborative environments and continuous learning. Currently, I am immersed in a data-driven project aimed at honing my skills in Pandas for data analysis and manipulation, while also exploring the fundamentals of machine learning. My goal is to work with ML/AI all while fostering a positive, inclusive work culture.

Originally conceived as a single project, I soon discovered some features that Streamlit has to offer, especially when it comes to the visualization of data. While Streamlit is primarily designed for web application dashboarding, its extensive features contribute to a more visually appealing interface that is lightweight.

With Streamlit, I have decided to transform this single project into a portfolio. It will serve as a repository for the primary purpose of showcasing my personal projects, demonstrating my skills, and building credibility. Furthermore, throughout my endeavor, my aim is to offer my code as open-source with hopes to encourage other learners to pursue their educational journeys in a similar way. 

> **Note:** This portfolio primarily serves as a showcase for my projects. The sections within the portfolio are designed with template formatting to help viewers understand the structure and allows for potential ideas to expand off of.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries have been installed using pip:

- `streamlit`
- `streamlit_option_menu`
